    title: Install react-joyride and add onboarding state to canvasStore
    description: |
      Install `react-joyride` in the frontend. Add `showOnboarding` boolean and
      `setShowOnboarding` action to `canvasStore`. Persist completion in localStorage
      (`infinite-adventures-onboarding-complete`). First-time visitors default to true,
      returning visitors default to false.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - react-joyride installed in frontend
      - canvasStore has showOnboarding / setShowOnboarding

    title: Create OnboardingTour component with guided steps
    description: |
      Create `frontend/src/components/OnboardingTour.tsx` using react-joyride with 7 steps:
      welcome, toolbar, item panel, connections, page toggle, search/filter, settings.

      Add `data-tour` attributes to Toolbar, PageToggle, search/filter Stack, and
      SettingsButton. Render in MemberLayout when `showOnboarding` is true. Use continuous
      mode with Next/Back/Skip. On completion or skip, call `setShowOnboarding(false)`.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - OnboardingTour renders 7-step tour via react-joyride
      - data-tour attributes added to Toolbar, PageToggle, search/filter, SettingsButton
      - Tour renders in MemberLayout when showOnboarding is true
      - Completing or skipping sets showOnboarding to false
